				<p> Our Mission: </p>
				<p>Resist Today is a website that was created on July 16, 2018. The three founders, Irina, Gabrielle, and Gabriella, wanted to create a place where activists could organize protests.</p>
				<p>In our time, we have seen our elected officials fail us. We wanted to provide a platform where people could take change into their own hands, from abortion rights to gun laws. We would like to give everybody the ability to <b>resist</b>.</p>
